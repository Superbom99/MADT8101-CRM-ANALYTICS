Imagine you have a favorite ice cream shop, and you go there all the time to buy their delicious ice cream. Churn scoring is like predicting whether you might suddenly stop going to that ice cream shop and switch to another one.

Churn means when people stop using a service or buying a product from a company. So, churn scoring is when a company tries to figure out which customers are more likely to leave and go somewhere else. They do this by looking at different things like how often you visit the shop, how much you like their ice cream, and maybe even if they change the flavors often.

They take all this information and use it to give you a "churn score." If your churn score is high, it means you might be thinking about leaving the ice cream shop. The company can then try to do something special to make you stay, like giving you a discount or introducing new exciting flavors to keep you interested.

In a more technical way, churn scoring involves analyzing data about customers to find patterns that might show who's likely to leave. This helps the company take action before you actually stop coming to the shop. So, churn scoring is like a clever way for companies to guess who might stop being their customers and try to keep them happy!
