## The design of a customer data platform for a hotel business includes a **single customer view table**. 

This table is a **centralized repository** of all customer data that is collected by the hotel. It provides a **360-degree view** of the customer, including their **preferences**, **behaviors**, and **interactions** with the hotel. The single customer view table can be used to create personalized experiences for customers, such as **tailored marketing campaigns** and **customized offers**. It can also be used to improve operational efficiency by providing a **unified view** of the customer across all departments.

## Key benefits of having a Single Customer View:

1. **Enhanced Customer Understanding:**
2. **Improved Customer Experience:** 
3. **Personalized Marketing:**
4. **Reduced Data Silos:**
5. **Better Decision-Making:**
6. **Efficient Customer Support:**
7. **Cross-Selling and Upselling Opportunities:**

In conclusion, a Single Customer View brings together data from various sources to provide a holistic understanding of customers. This understanding leads to improved customer experiences, more effective marketing strategies, streamlined operations, and ultimately, better business outcomes. However, it's important to note that implementing a successful SCV strategy requires careful consideration of data privacy, security, and integration challenges.
