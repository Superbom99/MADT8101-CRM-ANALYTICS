## The design of a customer data platform for a hotel business includes a **single customer view table**. 

This table is a **centralized repository** of all customer data that is collected by the hotel. It provides a **360-degree view** of the customer, including their **preferences**, **behaviors**, and **interactions** with the hotel. The single customer view table can be used to create personalized experiences for customers, such as **tailored marketing campaigns** and **customized offers**. It can also be used to improve operational efficiency by providing a **unified view** of the customer across all departments.
