# Customer Segmentation & Product Recommendation

Let's dive into customer segmentation and product recommendation in a simple way.

## **Customer Segmentation:**
Okay, imagine you have a big box of different colored crayons. Now, think about your friends. Some of them really love drawing animals, some like to make colorful patterns, and others enjoy drawing buildings or cars. Customer segmentation is kind of like sorting your crayons based on what your friends want to draw.

In the business world, companies have lots of customers who like different things. Customer segmentation is when they group these customers together based on what they're interested in or what they buy. This helps the company better understand its customers and offers things that each group likes just like you would give your animal-loving friend the crayons with all the animal colors!

## **Product Recommendation:**
Imagine you're in a library, and you've just finished reading a really cool adventure book. Now, the librarian comes up and says, "Since you liked that adventure book, you might also enjoy these other adventure books." That's basically what product recommendation is like, but with things you might want to buy.

Companies collect information about what you've bought before, just like the librarian knows what books you've read. Then, they use this information to suggest other things you might like. For example, if you bought a superhero action figure, they might recommend a comic book with those same superheroes.

Behind the scenes, computers are really good at looking at lots of information and figuring out what things are similar. So, they help companies suggest products that you might be interested in based on what you've shown interest in before.

So, customer segmentation is like grouping people with similar interests, and product recommendation is like a helpful suggestion from a librarian but for things you might want to buy!
